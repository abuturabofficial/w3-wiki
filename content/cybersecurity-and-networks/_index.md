## UOM Cybersecurity Specialization

Cybersecurity Specialization is an advanced course offered by **University of Maryland**. It dives deep into the core topics related to software security, cryptography, hardware etc.

> My progress in this specialization came to a halt after completing the first course, primarily because the subsequent courses were highly advanced and required background knowledge that I lacked. I will resume my journey once I feel confident in possessing the necessary expertise to tackle those courses.
