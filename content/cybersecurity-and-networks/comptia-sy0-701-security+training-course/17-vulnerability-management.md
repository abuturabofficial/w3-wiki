## Vulnerability Scanning

Usually minimally invasive
- Unlike a penetration test

Port scan
- Poke around and see what's open

Identify system
- And security devices

Test from the outside and inside
- Don't dismiss insider threats

Gather as much information as possible
- We'll separate wheat from chaff later

### Static Code Analyzer

Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Help to identify security flaws

Many security vulnerabilities found easily
- Buffer overflows, database injections, etc.

Not everything can be identified through analysis
- Authentication security, insecure cryptography, etc.
- Don't rely on automation for everything

Still have to verify each finding
- False positives are an issue

### Dynamic Analysis (fuzzing)

Send random input to an application
- Fault-injecting, robustness testing, syntax testing, negative testing

Looking for something out of the ordinary
- Application crash, server error, exception

1988 class project at the University of Wisconsin
- "Operating System Utility Program Reliability"
- Professor Barton Miller
- The Fuzz Generator

### Fuzzing Engines and Frameworks

Many fuzzing options
- Platform specific, language specific, etc.

Very time and processor resource heavy
- Many, many iterations to try
- Many fuzzing engines use high-probability tests

Carnegie Mellon Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
- CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)

### Package Monitoring

Some applications are distributed in a package
- Especially open source
- Supply chain integrity

Confirm the package is legitimate
- Trusted source
- No added malware
- No embedded vulnerabilities

Confirm a safe package before deployment
- Verify the contents

## Threat Intelligence

Research the threats
- And the threat actors

Data is everywhere
- Hacker group profiles, tools used by the attackers, and much more

Make decisions based on this intelligence
- Invest in the best prevention

Used by researchers, security operations teams, and others

### Open-source Intelligence (OSINT)

Open-source
- Publicly available sources
- A good place to start

Internet
- Discussion groups, social media

Government data
- Mostly public hearings, reports, websites, etc.

Commercial data
- Maps, financial reports, databases

### Proprietary/Third-party Intelligence

Someone else has already compiled the threat information
- You can buy it

Threat intelligence services
- Threat analysis
- Correlation across different data sources

Constant threat monitoring
- Identify new threats
- Create automated prevention workflows

### Information-sharing Organization

Public threat intelligence
- Often classified information

Private threat intelligence
- Private companies have extensive resources

Need to share critical security details
- Real-time, high-quality cyber threat information sharing

Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA)
- Members upload specifically formatted threat intelligence
- CTA scores each submission and validates across other submissions
- Other members can extract the validated data

### Dark Web Intelligence

Dark website
- Overlay networks that use the Internet
- Requires specific software and configurations to access

Hacking groups and services
- Activities
- Tools and techniques
- Credit card sales
- Accounts and passwords

Monitor forums for activity
- Company names, executive names

## Penetration Testing

Pentest
- Simulate an attack

Similar to vulnerability scanning
- Except we actually try to exploit the vulnerabilities

Often a compliance mandate
- Regular penetration testing by a 3rd-party

National Institute of Standards and Technology
- Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment
    - https://professormesser.link/800115 (PDF Download)

### Rules of Engagement

An important document
- Defines purpose and scope
- Makes everyone aware of the test parameters

Type of testing and schedule
- On-site physical breach, internal test, external test
- Normal working hours, after 6 PM only, etc.

The rules
- IP address ranges
- Emergency contacts
- How to handle sensitive information
- In-scope and out-of-scope devices or appliances

### Exploiting Vulnerabilities

Try to break into the system
- <span style="color: red;">Be careful; this can cause a denial of service or loss of data</span>
- Buffer overflows can cause instability
- Gain privilege escalation

You may need to try many vulnerability types
- Password brute-force
- Social engineering
- Database injections
- Buffer overflows

You will only be sure you're vulnerable if you can bypass security
- If you can get through, the attackers can get through

### The Process

Initial exploitation
- Get into the network

Lateral movement
- Move from system to system
- The inside of the network is relatively unprotected

Persistence
- Once you are there, you need to make sure there is a way back in
- Set up a backdoor, build user accounts, change or verify default passwords

The pivot
- Gain access to systems that would normally not be accessible
- Use a vulnerable system as a proxy or relay

### Responsible Disclosure Program

It takes tie to fix a vulnerability
- Software changes, testing, deployment, etc.

Bug bounty programs
- A reward for discovering vulnerabilities
- Earn money for hacking a system
- Document the vulnerability to earn cash

A controlled information release
- Researcher reports the vulnerability
- Manufacturer creates a fix
- The vulnerability is announced publicly

## Analyzing Vulnerabilities

### Dealing with False Information

False positives
- A vulnerability is identified that doesn't really exist

This is different from a low-severity vulnerability
- It's real, but it may not be your highest priority

False negatives
- A vulnerability exists, but you didn't detect it

Update to the latest signatures
- If you don't know about it, you can't see it

Work with the vulnerability detection manufacturer
- They may need to update their signatures for your environment

### Prioritizing Vulnerabilities

Not every vulnerability shares the same priority
- Some may not be significant
- Others may be critical

This may be difficult to determine
- The research has probably already been done

Refer to public disclosures and vulnerability databases
- The industry is well versed
- Online discussion groups, public disclosure mailing lists

### CVSS

National Vulnerability Database
- https://nvd.nist.gov/
- Synchronized with the CVE list
- Enhanced search functionality

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
- Quantitative scoring of a vulnerability — 0 to 10
- The scoring standards change over time
- Different scoring for CVSS 2.0 vs. CVSS 3.x

Industry collaboration
- Enhanced feed sharing and automation

### CVE

The vulnerabilities can be cross-referenced online
- Almost all scanners give you a place to go

National Vulnerability Database
- https://nvd.nist.gov

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)
- https://cve.mitre.org/cve

Microsoft Security Bulletins
- https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide

Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively identified
- You will have to check manually to see if a system is vulnerable
- The scanner gives you a heads-up

### Vulnerability Classification

The scanner looks for everything
- Well, not everything — The signatures are the key

Application scans
- Desktop, mobile apps

Web application scans
- Software on a web server

Network scans
- Misconfigured firewalls, open ports, vulnerable devices

### Exposure Factor

Loss of value or business activity if the vulnerability is exploited
- Usually expressed as a percentage

 A small DDoS may limit access to a service
 - 50% exposure factor
A buffer overflow may completely disable a service
- 100% exposure factor

A consideration when prioritizing
- Worst possible outcome probably gets priority

### Environmental Variables

What type of environment is associated with this vulnerability?
- Internal server, public cloud, test lab

Prioritization and patching frequency 
- A device in an isolated test lab
- A database server in the public cloud
- Which environment gets priority?

Every environment is different
- Number and type of users (internal, external)
- Revenue generating application
- Potential for exploit

### Industry/Organizational Impact

Some exploits have signal-to-noise consequences
- The type of organization is an important consideration

Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare — February 2023
- Ransomware — closed for two weeks
- Diverted emergency cases, surgeries cancelled

Power utilities — Salt Lake City, Utah and LA County, California — March 2019
- DDoS attacks from an unpatched known vulnerability

### Risk Tolerance

The amount of risk acceptable to an organization
- It's important to remove all risk

The timing of security patches
- Patching immediately doesn't allow for proper testing

Testing takes time
- While you're testing, you're also vulnerable

There's a middle ground
- May change based on the severity

## Vulnerability Remediation

### Patching

The most common mitigation technique
- We know the vulnerability exists
- We have a patch file to install

Scheduled vulnerability/patch notices
- Monthly, quarterly

Unscheduled patches
- Zero-day, often urgent

This is an ongoing process
- The patches keep coming
- An easy way to prevent most exploits

### Insurance

Cybersecurity insurance coverage
- Lost revenue
- Data recovery costs
- Money lost to phishing
- Privacy lawsuit costs

Doesn't cover everything
- Intentional acts, funds transfers, etc.

Ransomware has increased popularity of cybersecurity liability insurance
- Applies to every organization

### Segmentation

Limit the scope of an exploit
- Separate devices into their own networks/VLANs

A breach would have limited scope
- It's not as bad as it could be

Can't patch?
- Disconnect from the world
- Air gaps may be required

Use internal NGFWS
- Block unwanted/unnecessary traffic between VLANs
- Identify malicious traffic on the inside

### Physical Segmentation

Separate devices
- Multiple units, separate infrastructure

![](/notes/comptia-sy0-701-security+training-course/17-vulnerability-management-3.webp)

### Logical Segmentation with VLANs

Virtual Local Area Network (VLANs)
- Separated logically instead of physically
- Cannot communicate between VLANs without a layer 3 device/router

### Compensating Controls

Optimal security methods may not be available
- Can't deploy a patch right now
- No internal firewalls

Compensate in other ways
- Disable the problematic service
- Revoke access to the application
- Limit external access
- Modify internal security controls and software firewalls

Provide coverage until a patch is deployed
- Or similar optimal security response

### Exceptions and Exemptions

Removing the vulnerability is optimal
- But not everything can be patched

A balancing act
- Provide the service, but also protect the data and systems

Not all vulnerabilities share the same severity
- May require local login, physical access, or other criteria

An exception may be an option
- Usually a formal process to approve

### Validation of Remediation

The vulnerability is now patched
- Does the patch really stop the exploit?
- Did you patch all vulnerable systems?

Rescanning
- Perform an extensive vulnerability scan

Audit
- Check remediated systems to ensure the patch was successfully deployed

Verification
- Manually confirm the security of the system

### Reporting

Ongoing checks are required
- New vulnerabilities are continuously discovered

Difficult (or impossible) to manage without automation
- Manual checks would be time-consuming

Continuous reporting
- Number of identified vulnerabilities
- Systems patched vs. unpatched
- New threat notifications
- Errors, exception, and exemptions
