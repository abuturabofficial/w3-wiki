- Replacing a core OS file
- Uploading sensitive files

Unexpected behavior
- Logon from another country
- Increase in data transfers

Unintentional behavior
- Typing the wrong domain name
- Misplacing USB drives
- Misconfiguring security settings

### Reporting and Monitoring

Track and analyze security awareness metrics
- Automated 
- Phishing click rates
- Password manager adoption, MFA use, password sharing

Initial
- First occurrence is an opportunity for user training
- Work towards avoiding the issue in the future

Recurring
- The value of long-term monitoring
- Identify high-frequency security issues
- Help users with multiple occurrences

### Development

Create a Security Awareness team
- Determine roles for training, monitoring, policy creation, etc.

Establish a minimum awareness level
- Information delivery (emails, posters, notices, training)
- Depth of training based on job function

Integrate compliance mandates
- PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.

Define metrics
- Assess the performance of security awareness programs
- Make updates in lower-performance areas

### Execution

Create the training materials
- Provided to users in different forms

Document success measurements
- How will we know the awareness is working?

Identify the stakeholders
- Provide ongoing metrics and performance data

Deploy the training material
- Classroom training, posters, weekly emails, etc.

Track user training efforts

- This is often controlled using technology (Group Policy)

Removable media and cables
- Unknown USB drives can contain malware
- Unknown cables can be malicious

Social engineering
- Extensive and ongoing training
- The attackers are very good 
- The users are your front line defense

Operational security
- View security from the attacker's perspective
- Users need to identify sensitive data
- Keep the sensitive data private

Hybrid/remote work environments
- Working at home brings unusual security risks
- No access to family and friends
- Additional endpoint security
- Security policies for VPN access
