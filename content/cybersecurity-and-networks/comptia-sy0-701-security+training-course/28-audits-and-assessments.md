## Audits and Assessments

Not just for taxes
- There are good reasons to audit your technology

Cybersecurity audit
- Examines the IT infrastructure, software, devices, etc.
- Checks for effectiveness of policies and procedures
- Find vulnerabilities before the attackers
- Can be performed internally or by a third party

Attestation
- Provides an opinion of truth or accuracy of a company's security positioning
- An auditor will attest to a company's cybersecurity posture

### Internal Audits

Audits aren't just for third-parties
- You should also have internal audits

Compliance
- Is your organization complying with regulatory or industry requirements?

Audit committee
- Oversees risk management activities
- All audits start and stop with the committee

Self-assessments
- Have the organization perform their own checks
- Consolidate the self-assessments into ongoing reports

### External Audits

Regulatory requirements
- An independent third-party may be required to perform the audit
- Audit type and frequency are often based on the regulation

Examinations
- Audits will often require hands-on research
- View records, compile reports, gather additional details

Assessment 
- Audit will assess current activities
- May also provide recommendation for future improvements

## Penetration Tests

### Physical Penetration Testing

OS security can be circumvented by physical means
- Modify the boot process
- Boot from other media
- Modify or replace OS files

Physical security is key
- Prevent access by unauthorized individuals

Assess and test physical security
- Can you enter a building without a key?
- What access is available inside?
- Doors, windows, elevators, physical security processes

### Pentesting Perspectives

Offensive
- The red team
- Attack the systems and look for vulnerabilities to exploit

Defensive
- The blue team
- Identify attacks in real-time
- Prevent any unauthorized access

Integrated
- Create an ongoing process
- Identify and patch exploitable systems and services
- Test again

### Working Knowledge

How much do you know about the test?
- Many approaches

Known environment
- Full disclosure

Partially known environment
- A mix of known and unknown
- Focus on certain systems or applications

Unknown environment
- The pentester knows nothing about the systems under attack
- "Blind" test

### Reconnaissance

Need information before the attack
- Can't rush blindly into battle

Gathering a digital footprint
- Learn everything you can

Understand the security posture
- Firewalls, security configuration

Minimize the attack area
- Focus on key systems

Create a network map
- Identify routers, networks, remote sites

### Passive Reconnaissance

↻ Learn as much as you can from open sources
- There's a lot of information out there
- Remarkably difficult to protect or identify

↻ Social media

↻ Corporate website

↻ Online forums, Reddit

↻ Social Engineering

↻ Dumpster diving
 
↻ Business organizations

### Active Reconnaissance

↻ Trying the doors
- Maybe one is unlocked
- Don't open it yet
- Relatively easy to be seen

↻ Visible on network traffic and logs

↻ Ping scans, port scans

↻ DNS scans, OS fingerprinting

↻ Service scans, version scans
