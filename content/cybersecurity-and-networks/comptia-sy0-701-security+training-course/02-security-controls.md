## Control Categories

- **Technical Controls**
    + Controls implemented using systems
    + OSes controls
    + Firewalls, anti-viruses
- **Managerial Controls**
    + Admin controls associated with security design and implementation
    + Security policies, SOPs
- **Operational Controls**
    + Controls implemented by people instead of systems
    + Security guards, awareness programs
- **Physical Controls**
    + Limit physical access
    + Guard shack
    + Fences, locks
    + Badge readers

### Preventive Control Types

- **Preventive**
    - Block access to a resource
    - You shall not pass
- **Prevent access**
    - Firewall rules
    - Follow security policy
    - Guard shack checks all identification

### Corrective Control Types

- **Corrective**
    - Apply a control after an event has been detected
    - Reverse the impact of an event
    - Continue operating with minimal downtime
- **Correct the problem**
    - Restoring from backups can mitigate a ransomware infection
    - Create policies for reporting security issues
    - Contact law enforcement to manage criminal activity

### Compensating Control Types

- **Compensating**
    - Control using other means

    - Implement a separation of duties
    - Require simultaneous guard duties
    - Generator used after power outage

### Directive Control Types

    - There are many categories of control
    - Some organizations will combine types
- **There are multiple security controls for each category and type**
    - Some security controls may exist in multiple types or categories
    - New security controls are created as systems and processes evolve
    - Your organization may use very different controls
