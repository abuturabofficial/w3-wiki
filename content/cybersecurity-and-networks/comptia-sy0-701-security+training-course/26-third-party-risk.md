## Third-party Risk Assessment

Every organization works with vendors
- Payroll, customer relationship management, email marketing, travel, raw materials

Important company data is often shared
- May be required for cloud-based services

Perform a risk assessment
- Categorize risk by vendor and manage the risk

Use contracts for clear understanding
- Make sure everyone understands the expectations
- Use the contract to enforce a secure environment

### Penetration Testing

Pentest
- Simulate an attack

Similar to vulnerability scanning
- Except we actually try to exploit the vulnerabilities

Often a compliance mandate
- May include a legal requirement

Regular penetration testing by a 3rd-party
- Very specialized 
- Third-party experts are well-versed

### Rules of Engagement

An important document
- Defines purpose and scope
- Makes everyone aware of the test parameters

Type of testing and schedule
- On-site physical breach, internal test, external test
- Normal working hours, after 6 PM only, etc.

The rules
- IP address ranges
- Emergency contacts
- How to handle sensitive information
- In-scope and out-of-scope devices or applications

### Right-to-audit Clauses

Common to work business partners
- Data sharing 
- Outsourcing

Third-party providers
- Can hold all the data
- Manage internet access
- Are they secure?

Right-to-audit should be in the contract
- A legal agreement to have the option to perform a security audit at any time
- Everyone agrees to the terms and conditions
- Ability to verify security before a breach occurs

### Evidence of Internal Audit

Evaluate the effectiveness of security controls
- Have a third party perform an audit

May be required for compliance
- It's a good idea, even without industry standards

Check for security controls and processes
- Access management, off boarding, password security, VPN controls, etc.
- There's always an opportunity for improvement

Perform at a reasonable frequency
- A single audit isn't very helpful in the long-term

### Supply Chain Analysis

The system involved when creating a product
- Involves organizations, people, activities, and resources

Supply chain analysis
- Get a product or service from supplier to customer
- Evaluate coordination between groups
- identify areas of improvement
- Assess the IT systems supporting the operation
- Document the business process changes

Software update installs malware: March-June 2020
- Announced December 2020 by SolarWinds
- Malware deployed with a valid SolarWinds digital signature
- At least 18,000 of 300,000 customers potentially impacted

### Independent Assessments

Bring in a smart person or team to evaluate security and provide recommendations
- An outside firm

Specialists in their field
- They do this all day, every day

They've seen it all
- And can provide options you may not have considered

### Vendor Selection Process

Due diligence
- Check a company out before doing business
- Investigate and verify information
- Financial status, pending or past legal issues, etc.
- Background checks, personnel interviews

Conflict of interest
- A personal interest could compromise judgment
- A potential partner also does business with your largest competitor
- A third-party employs the brother of the CFO
- A third-party offers gifts if a contract is signed

### Vendor Monitoring

Ongoing management of the vendor relationship
- This doesn't end when the contract is signed

Reviews should occur on a regular basis
- Financial health check, IT security reviews, news articles, social media posts

Different vendors may be checked for different indicators
- Quantitative and qualitative analysis

Assign a person to be in charge of the vendor relationship
- They will manage the monitoring process

### Questionnaires

An important part of due diligence and ongoing vendor monitoring
- Get answers directly from the vendor

Security-related questions
- What is the vendor's due diligence process?
- What plans are in place for disaster recovery?
- What secure storage method is used for company data?
- And more

Results are used to update a vendor risk analysis
- Updated during the life of the vendor relationship
