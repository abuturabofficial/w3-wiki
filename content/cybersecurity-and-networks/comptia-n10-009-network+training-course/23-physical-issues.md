## Cable Issues

### Using the correct fiber optics

![](/notes/comptia-n10-009-network+training-course/23-physical-issues-1.webp)

### Fiber mismatching

Core and cladding sizes are relatively standard
- Fiber and frequencies must match equipment
- Signal errors will be seen on the interface

There will be writing on the cable about size and type.

### Cable Categories

Cable construction is standardized
- Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA)

TIA sets the minimum physical cable parameters
- Cables meeting the standard are assigned a category (cat)
- Insertion loss, near end crosstalk, far end crosstalk, etc.

IEEE networking standards refer to the TIA cable categories
- 1000BASE-T minimum cable is category 5
- 10GBASE-T minimum cable is category 6 and 6A

### Using the right cable

Speed/bandwidth
- Theoretical maximum data rate
- Usually measured in bits per second
- The size of the pipe

Throughput
- Amount of data transferred in a given timeframe
- Usually measured in bits per second
- How much water is flowing through the pipe

Distance 
- Know the maximum distance
- Varies based on copper, fiber, repeaters, etc.

### The right cable category

Validate the cable
- Use best practices during installation
- Tester matches to the closest cable category

Cable should meet the minimum requirements
- Physical errors will increase error counts
- Signal attenuation (transmission loss), loss of signal, CRC errors

### Unshielded and shielded cable

UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
- No additional metal shielding
- The most common twisted pair cabling

STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
- Additional shielding protects against interference
- Shield each pair and/or the overall cable
- Requires the cable to be grounded

### Crosstalk (XT)
